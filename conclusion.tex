\section{Conclusion}

We have introduced Twoville, a new platform for computational making. The bidirectional editor allows programmer-artists to shape structures both algorithmically and aesthetically. The digital design is exported as an SVG file and loaded in a fabrication tool, which cuts or engraves it in physical material.

Our primary goal in building Twoville is to use it as a vehicle for empowering young learners in makerspaces and schools to apply the mathematics and computation that they are learning to creative physical construction. The next steps for us in this process are to form partnerships with teachers and media specialists and to develop lessons and exercises that we can use in classrooms and outreaches. At the time of this writing, we are using Twoville in a summer camp, and we have plans to use it in a weekly after-school program this next academic year.
